  <h1>Practical Front-End Projects with Pure Javascript, CSS, and HTML</h1>

<p>A collection of practical, easy to use front-end related projects for enthusiasts and beginners. The main purpose is to learn. The codes are free and always will be.

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<h3>&bull;Webpack, gulp or any another bundler has not been used.</h3>
<h4>&bull;Third-party libraries were not used.</h4>
<h5>&bull;Codes are mostly supported by modern browsers.</h5>
<h6>&#8226;Projects are only for educational purposes</h6>


<h7>Running locally</h7>
It's so simple. Clone or download the repository, open project directory and open index.html in your browser. As I mentioned above, there is not any bundler and all scripts have been injected in the HTML.

<h8>New projects are being prepared</h8>
I'll try to make this repo very useful. So, I really looking forward to your help and comments to make this better.
